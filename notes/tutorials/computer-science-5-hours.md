# Computer Science in 5 Hours

By Brian Holt

## Intro
 
He wrote this material because he was frustrated on engineer interviews. Interviews sometimes asks complicated theory concepts even when they are not related to that job. So he made this to, at least in theory, let the people know some computer concepts.

### Science of tradeoffs

He mentioned that you'll always decide between readable code, more efficient code, optimized code.

But his advice 95% go for readable code. As Kyle simpson said, you're saving it for other people or your future self.

## Big O

Big O is the theoretical formula of how complex the algorithm is. It is broad strokes comparison on how would our code could perform on big data. It is like 300ms vs 30s. It isn't like 300ms vs 330ms.
