# Requirements

### Script Development
* sequence of instructions to operate
* Javascript, PHP, Ruby
* handle instructions / commands based on events

### Dev Ops
* it is a community of practices
* with a purpose to study, handle rapidly-changing systems at scale

### Agile
* Management framework - aims to build software in an incremental way
* Deliver software in short bursts

Benefits: 
* Visible
  * Working from the start
* Adaptible 
  * Can make changes in iteration
  * Target dates are less critical
  * Scope can be easily tweaked up and down

#### Some Methodologies
* ##### Scrum
  * Aims all to move forward
  * Cycle Process:
    1. Product Backlog
    2. Sprint Review -> Sprint Backlog
    3. Daily Scrum -> Sprints (2 - 4 Weeks)
    4. Deliver
  * Always within these 3 topics:
    1. What was covered since the last meeting?
    2. What was the intended task for today?
    3. Any impediments?
  * Roles
    1. Product Owner
    2. Dev Team
    3. Scrum Master

* ##### Kanban
  * Focuses on delivery and not overloading devs
  * Rules:
    1. Visualize the workflow
    2. Limit work in progres
    3. Manage the flow
    4. Make process policies explicit
    5. Improve collaboratively
  * Process Board:
    1. Todo
    2. Ready
    3. Doing
    4. Done



### Lean

#### From Youtube
Benefits:
  * Amplify learning - customer feedback
  * Empower the team - Allow team know the product
  * Eliminate the waste
  * Deliver as fast as possible
  * Decide late as possible

Process:
1. One-Page document
2. Scope
3. Content Creation Flow
4. Eliminate waste - Determine 80% vital to the product first
5. Page / Screen Definition
  * Wireframing: 
    1. Functional Wireframe - Wireframe that determines function but the design is not final
    2. Design Wireframe - Function with more details
6. Test flow on wireframes
7. User Stories - short explanation from user point of view
  * Putting it into story state:
    1. Icebox
    2. Backlog
    3. Pending
    4. Staging / Testing
    5. Accepted
    6. Rejected
    7. Production
8. Closed Loop - very basic implementation of the feature, focus to deliver as fast as possible
  * writing code
  * Code review

9. Staging Deployment
  * manual acceptance testing
  * automatic / regression testing - 
    1. Unit tests
    2. or integration testings

10. refactoring
  * maintianability
  * prevent technical debt

11. Launch

#### from LinkedIn Learning
* It is a systematic method to eliminate waste and maximize the flow of value through a system
* Focuses on continuous improvement
* Uses Statistics to monitor
* Just In Time Delivery - decrease waste by making goods only as they are needed

##### Principles
* Small Deliverables and limiting WIP
* Information stats and visibility
* Gathering and implementing customer feedback
* Empower dev teams

### Continuous Delivery
* Agile/Lean approach which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that it is reliably released at any time

### SDLC
* Phase driven software development process

#### Phases
* Requirements 
* Design 
* Engineering 
* Construction 
* Testing 
* Debugging 
* Deployment 
* Maintenance

#### Practices
* Continuous Integration - Merging all developer copies on a mainline several times a day
* Prototyping - Creating incomplete versions of software being developed.
* Incremental development - splitting project in smaller segments, reducing project risk and providing ease of change
* Rapid - Planning process is almost same time as writing code

#### Methodologies
* Agile - like iterative
* Waterfall dev - sequential development approach
* Spiral - Combines waterfall and rapid

### AJAX programming
* Allows web pages to be updated on the fly by exchanging data with a web server behind without reloading the whole page

### Basic MS SQL

### Diff Database technology
* NoSQL vs SQL / Non-relational vs Relational / (MongoDB, CouchDB, redis, Apache, cassandra) vs (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite)
* NoSQL:
  1. Advantages
    * flexible
    * faster
  2. Disadvantages
    * normalization is bad
    * No relation
    * Can introduce bugs during migration since there's no standard relation
* SQL:
  1. Advantages:
    * Relational
    * Better Normalization - reduces redundancy
    * Data integrity options
  2. Disadvantages
    * slower than NoSQL
    * takes more time to plan out
    * inflexible

### Why Do you want to be a developer

### Work history about development

### What is servicenow
* SAAS providing technical support, based on ITSM framework. Ticketing system with a library of solutions, incidents, events, and other reports

### ITSM framework
* entirety of activities, with policies and procedures to design, plan, deliver, operate, and control IT Services
