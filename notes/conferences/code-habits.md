## Chat advices

> Another piece of advice I wanted to mention in the presentation and I forgot: If possible, for your first tech job don't take the first thing that comes your way. If at all possible, consider it carefully - because as you learn every day you become more valuable, and you don't have to jump on the first opportunity coming your way - be very careful, Listen to the words that indicate what the culture of the company is like

> Also, make sure you meet your direct manager during the interview (esp if the company is big)
