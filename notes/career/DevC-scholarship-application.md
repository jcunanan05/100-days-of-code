# Why do I want `this` Scholarship

Hi, my name is Jonathan Albert Cunanan and I am an aspiring front-end developer / front-end engineer. I came to encounter and love web development when I was 21. Today, I am now comfortable building apps with `react`, coupled with basic tooling (`linting`, `auto-format`, `module-bundler`). With all these concepts and tools, I will need to also learn about _best practices_, _application architecture_, and also the _business side_ of development as well. So I think, getting a scholarship, and advices from mentors will give me a super boost to advance my journey in web dev!

## Early Days

In my early days, forums says "Use a framework!", so I watched _zero-to-hero_ videos at [laracasts.com](https://laracasts.com/). Those were pretty helpful, but as soon as I want to customize, I just can't do what I want. I feel I am missing some common knowledge so I need the fundamentals. Luckily, I found [freeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) as a great start. I now have a comfortable understanding on which components a robust, production-ready app has.
