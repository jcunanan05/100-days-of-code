# Introduction:

## Who am I:

Hi, I'm Jonathan, Just got here in Canada for almost a year. I encountered Web Dev 2 years ago. That took introductory online courses for (PHP, Ruby, Rails, Laravel, Android, Python, Git.) But last October, I encountered javascript and react, and been loving it since.

From there, I took it seriously. I realized that to advance my career in tech, I need to learn more than introduction. I need to learn about app architecture and the processes.

## What I've been doing now:

I've been studying **react & redux** by making front-end personal projects in freeCodeCamp curriculum. Been taking state management course at [frontendmasters.com](). The course is about different POV about state management (flux, redux, redux middlewares, mobx)

I also have a volunteer project as of now. It's build with Next.js (React SSR) Express.js, SASS, and Contentful CMS. [https://stepupnow.herokuapp.com]() I feel a little bit fatigued / lost on **tooling and config**. And on testing too.

## My goals

My goals really is to be a front-end engineer or everything that involves web dev. I've been everyday studying and coding since last year by myself. I feel that with the knowledge of others share to me, It will make me progress fast more. Tools change, but architecture, not so much. So I wanna get as much as I can on the experience of others.
