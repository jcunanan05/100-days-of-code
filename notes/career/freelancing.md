### Intro

It's easy to charge hourly rate. But that's not the case. You measure based on the project.

### How to charge?

No formulas. Trust yourself. Evaluate on this criteria:

- Efficiency, Urgency, Specialty, Effectiveness

The desired price is affected by your confidence.

#### Know your market price roughly

Don't refer to your company's salary. It doesn't include costs fro the office space, benefits, and laptops. Include them in your computation.

Refer to your friend

### Criteria Breakdown

- Efficiency - Hourly doesn't work if, e.g. you're full-stack dev, the startup doesn't have a designer, you work faster, less communication cost. It doesn't mean you get to be paid less if you deliver it earlier.

- Urgency - You can charge more if it's rushed. Risky, you must have high confidence in doing rushed.

- Specialty - If you're specialized on building systems you can charge more.

- Effectiveness - your achievement is worth. e.g. you have a paid app 130k people used.

### Don't sell yourself cheap

Measure your price and consider the criteria. Make first a quote and explain reasons. Make metrics to prove why.

### Getting a contract

Contracts must have clear definitions, expectations. Check the client's contract template. It might be outdated too.
Also you can leave a little bit of wiggle room, but what must be important, you musn't backdown from it.

Get a good lawyer.

### 6 tips from Mike

1. Contracts protects both parties
2. Don't work without contract
3. Make your lawyer review the contract. It might be outdated. Clients don't know what's inside their contract.
4. Anticipate negotiation, don't backdown on important stuff.

- IP transfers on full payment
- Termination fee / kill fee for without good reason. Termination fee might be the hours you've worked for, or the next pay
- Liability - it means you're in trouble and you bear responsibility

5. Lawyer must talk to lawyer - you might say yes or pressured to talk to a lawyer
6. Be confident about money - "If the client asks you, 'How much?' The moment you say 'Uhm' you lose 10k grand ðŸ˜‚"

### Takeaways
- Contracts up front
- Internal Allies
- Advisors
