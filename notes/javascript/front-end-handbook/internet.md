1. An http request is made when you type http://www.google.com, where:

- **http** is the protocol, a protocol for internet communication
- **www** is the host name
- **google.com** is the domain name

2. The request will go through the firewall (like a guard) and to your router/modem
3. router/Modem will pass the request to your ISPs like _(Rogers, Bell, PLDT, GoogleFiber)_. ISPs have servers and a DNS will process the url and figure out its IP address.
4. Browser will establish a connection and the IP that you're trying to reach will release a response
5. The response will be jump on to multiple servers in order for the response to get back to you.
6. Broswer will receive the http response and interpret the data, and display the website with all the design and such. :)
