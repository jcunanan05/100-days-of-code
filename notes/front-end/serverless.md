# Serverless notes

from a talk video that I watched from freeCodeCamp, I discovered that there are a ton of services we can do to enhance our power as front-end devs. There are a lot of back-end services offered out there and there are **cloud functions** / serverless we can deploy and just have a static site.

It's this time / era that front-end developer has so much tools. What used to be needed a backend server, there's a service for that and you just host a static site. There's also a new thing called functions as a service where your javascript functions have url.

### Why serverless? Why is it useful?

- Less cost. 10000 cloud function calls cost 50 cents.

- Less setup. You don't have to go through setting file permissions etc...

- Host a JAM Stack and post to a URL, That url is a cloud function that has your api keys. Hide your API keys while still keeping a static site.
