### Conventions
* Take advantage of the conventions - used to patterns for people
* Conventions example:
  * Logo upper left of the site

### Visual Hierarchy - make content easier to scan
* Typography is important
* **Build content for scanning**
  * Take advantage of bulleted lists - things that are seperated by commas
  * Short paragraphs
* Grouping of content
  * Put headings close to their paragraph content - avoid floating heading
  * Put breathing space on the end of content
* When using multiple headings, changes must be obvious
* **Bulleted Lists** - make sure to put breathing space between them
