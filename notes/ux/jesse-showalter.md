  * He used markdown

2. Make competitive set and audit
  * Competitive set - Making research on who's your competitors and what their website looks like
  * Competitive Audit - List of good and bad points / guidelines of the competitors
  * He used sketch

3. Wireframe and Moodboard
  * Wireframe is a barebones layout & design of the app. No real pics yet or content
  * Moodboard is collections of apps or sites that can display a potential mood of your app.
  * He used Invision
