> If youâ€™re thinking in terms of object-oriented programming, your first impulse might be to start defining objects for the various elements in the world. **This is wrong**

* Reflexively writing classes for every concept in your application tends to leave you with a collection of interconnected objects that each have their own internal, changing state. 
  * Such programs are often hard to understand and thus easy to break.

* Condense it down to a minimal set of values that define it first.
