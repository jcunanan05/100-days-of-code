## Secret Life of Objects

A kinda-similiar way of object-oriented programming is introduced here. The concept of inheritance is showed via _prototypes_

### Encapsulation
* > The core idea in object-oriented programming is to divide programs into smaller pieces and make each piece responsible for managing its own state.
* > Different pieces of such a program interact with each other through interfaces
  * Limited sets of tools, how it works under, is hidden.

* Interfaces are modeled using **objects**
* **Public** - code that can be accessed outside
* **Private** - code that can only be accessed inside
* Javascript don't have a distinct way to differentiate _public_ from _private_
* It is common to prefix `_` underscore at the start of property name
* > Separating interface from implementation is a great idea. It is usually called encapsulation.

### Methods
* Properties that hold function values
```javascript
let rabbit = {};
rabbit.speak = function(line) {
  console.log(`The rabbit says '${line}'`);
};

rabbit.speak("I'm alive."); // â†’ The rabbit says 'I'm alive.'
```

* You can access other bindings in the object using `this`
```javascript
function speak(line) {
  console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
}
let whiteRabbit = {type: "white", speak};
```
