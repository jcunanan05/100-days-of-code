### R4D1 15/11

- Setup express server and nunjucks templating
- Read about top NodeJs Hosting providers.
- Understood nothing about whats the price on deploying a webserver without database per month.

### R4D2 16/11

- Started coding the banner. Tried two experiment to create a desktop and mobile layout. 1st approach is to build 2 elements and hide them according to breakpoints. 2nd one is 1 element and think about how to structure them in mobile & desktop. 1st one didn't worked for me, went for 2nd haha.

### R4D3 17/11

- Fix some layout spacing and Added a warning state button for the landing page.

### R4D4 18/11

- Code my client work. Put some themed call-to-action buttons. Overriding classes in boostrap is hard. Well I guess that's their way of preventing confusion/bugs on their side. I like ease of overriding at bulma, which can also cause confusion on my end, and then blaming bulma haha
