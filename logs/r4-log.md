### R4D2 16/11

- Started coding the banner. Tried two experiment to create a desktop and mobile layout. 1st approach is to build 2 elements and hide them according to breakpoints. 2nd one is 1 element and think about how to structure them in mobile & desktop. 1st one didn't worked for me, went for 2nd haha.
